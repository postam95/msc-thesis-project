# MSC Thesis Summary

With this thesis project, I have undertaken to immerse myself in a field unknown to 
me, in the world of game development, including applied artificial intelligence, to expand 
my knowledge and gain experience. In the course of my literature search, I was first 
confronted with how much wood I had cut into the ax, as there has been an enormous body 
of knowledge on the subject over the past 50 years or so, as evidenced by a large amount of 
scientific articles, books, and other notes. This is simply because game development projects 
have reached unprecedented proportions, huge resources are available, demands are high, 
and this is giving a significant boost to developers to come up with newer and newer ideas, 
enhancing the gaming experience.

After exploring the intricate world of literature research, armed with the right 
knowledge, I was able to start the real work, the implementation of the game, which also 
provided me with valuable experience. Although I had some knowledge of game 
development in Unity, I had to get to know the task chosen for the thesis much more in depth.

Game development is a hard nut to crack. Perhaps one of the most difficult branches 
of software development is that it requires a wide range of skills and abilities from the 
developer. Not only is it a difficult programming task that requires knowledge of data 
structures and algorithms, but it is also a complex design job that requires the assembly of 
different and very different components to achieve optimal results.

A good gaming experience requires well-designed and beautifully crafted levels that 
are built from models and textures. Luckily, we now have a number of resources to get and 
use them for free while developing our game. Not only must the tracks hold challenges, but 
they also need to be beautiful and realistic to give the player the right experience and be 
sucked into reality by the virtual world, creating a lasting experience.

Once the tracks have been designed, the space needs to be “brought to life”, that is, 
provided with virtual characters. To do this, we must first start with the models and their 
animation in order to create the necessary conditions for their appearance. We can then turn 
to their behavior, which can range from extremely simple, non-responsive, static agents to 
characters with quite complex state machines, behavioral trees, or goal-oriented behavior.

The first major difficulty in preparing my thesis was to build some kind of system in 
the world of artificial intelligence in game development. The intelligence of games is a 
separate world and somewhat detached from academic artificial intelligence. This is an 
extremely practical area, the development of which is the responsibility of the developers 
who try to solve these problems in the best possible way every day, so the range of solutions 
is huge. Luckily, a number of books, notes, and articles undertook to organize them 
somewhat, and I fed on them in my work.

The next big challenge was to create the environment needed to develop artificial 
intelligence. This is because the artificial intelligence of games doesn’t work on its own, but 
you have to go through the game development process I detailed above to finally build 
autonomy into the game to make a round whole software.

Finally, the last challenge, of course, was to develop the artificial intelligence system 
itself. Different methods can be applied in different situations, and they have different 
advantages and disadvantages, which I tried to present during the dissertation. For example, 
a state machine is extremely well designed, transparent, and relatively easy to program and 
debug, but when programming more complex behaviors, it can easily result in spaghetti code 
that is difficult to scale and maintain.

During the game development, I managed to implement a state machine system that 
also supports communication between agents, which I also used on four agents.
A goal-oriented action planning framework was also developed, for which I implemented a 
character, and an agent automated with a behavioral tree was also used using an external 
program library.

My development plans include replacing the behavioral tree support library with a 
proprietary framework, and a comprehensive artificial intelligence framework that 
incorporates all three techniques that allow rapid and efficient development for those who 
choose Unity in an interactive, graphical interface to make their game, and want to quickly 
and easily create a playground that is bustling with diverse and unpredictable yet lifelike 
entities.

The critical part of the development is the monitoring of the system, the mapping and 
correction of possible errors, and for this I plan the implementation of efficient, also 
graphical tools, with the help of which the running of the algorithm can be monitored in real 
time and stopped at a given point.

All in all, during the development and writing of my dissertation, I gained a wealth 
of knowledge and experience that I am sure I can capitalize on in my future work. I would 
definitely like to further develop the game on which my thesis is based, not only in terms of 
artificial intelligence, but by adding complete levels, opponents and a full gameplay.
